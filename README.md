# Custom-Hooks-More-Realistic-Example
## Day 45  
After creating my own project again in firebase i will connect the add task app to the database. I can now see that custom hooks can be created whenever there is the need of multiple uses. So i will create a new folder called hooks in the src folder and inside that a new file called use-http.js so as to create my own hook. My file then looks like this ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/177600540-ef3d1986-5d81-4be2-80cb-54170352ee38.png)

## Day 47  
Finally i will use my custom hook in other components and implement it on my NewTask.js file. The code then transforms like this ![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/178102965-682880c3-a64d-4f46-ab77-2e2e99002b21.png)
